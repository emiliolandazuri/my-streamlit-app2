# README

## **Description**

Recover Eats is a health-monitoring web application that connects WHOOP fitness data with tailored meal recommendations. By integrating recovery metrics, workout data, sleep tracking, and nutritional APIs, Recover Eats provides users with personalized diet suggestions that align with their physical condition and fitness goals.

### Business Solution

In the growing health and fitness market, individuals use wearables like WHOOP to monitor sleep, recovery, heart rate, and strain. However, this raw data is often underutilized, lacking actionable feedback especially in nutrition.

#### Recover Eats bridges this gap by:
 - Interpreting WHOOP metrics to provide tailored dietary advice.
  
 - Encouraging data-driven meal planning.

 - Delivering recipe suggestions and ingredients via email for easy action.

 - Supporting fitness goals such as bulking, cutting, or maintaining.

 - “Bridging the Gap Between Fitness Recovery and Personalized Nutrition.”

### App Features
 Intelligent meal suggestions based on recovery score and workout intensity.
 
  - Diet goal customization: bulk, cut, or maintain.

  - Integration of WHOOP data: sleep, strain, body measurements.

  - Email delivery of suggested recipes.

  - Secure OAuth-based login.

### API Endpoints & Their Utility
You're absolutely right! GitHub-style markdown tables **can be tricky to read in raw `.md` files**, and if you want something more readable and visually engaging directly in the text, I recommend this **bullet point format with bold + code blocks + emojis**, which works great on GitHub and renders nicely.

Here’s the improved version that you can copy-paste directly into your `README.md`:

  Initiates the OAuth flow. It redirects the user to sign in and authorize access to WHOOP data.

* 🔑 **`/oauth/oauth2/token`**
  Exchanges the authorization code for an access token needed to fetch data.

* 💚 **`/developer/v1/recovery?limit=25`**
  Retrieves recovery data, including recovery score, resting heart rate, and skin temperature.

* 💪 **`/developer/v1/cycle?limit=7`**
  Gets recent strain/cycle metrics, including strain score and heart rate during daily activity.

- No error handling for missing API data.
 
- No persistent storage for user sessions or preferences.

### Future Improvements
- Add daily/weekly summary email scheduling.

- Enhance visuals with Plotly or Altair.

- Provide AI-based recommendations (e.g., trends in sleep or recovery).
